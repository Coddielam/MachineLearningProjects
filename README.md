# MachineLearningProjects
Hi! This repository contains some of my machine learning projects.

Currently this respository contains my most recent machine learning project with the infamous Titanic Dataset.

In this project, I cleaned the data, then conducted some exploratory analysis with some visualizations
to understand what factors determined the survival of a passenger on the Titanic ship.
Then I applied three classification models, which they are logistic regression, Sochastic Gradient Descent(SGD), 
and Decision Tree, to model the data. 
Finally, I compared the performances of the three models with cross validation testing and confusion matrix.
